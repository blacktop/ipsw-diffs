- "}\n            \n[Moment Instruction]: Give the user a 20-30 word pep talk when they start their elliptical workout. Begin the message by acknowledging their effort in starting this workout session. Then highlight any recent achievements or streaks. Keep the achievement/streak celebration specific and self-contained, meaning it conveys all necessary information (e.g., workout type, metric, time scale) for a user to fully understand the statement without relying on the fitness context or additional information. Focus on positive reinforcement, and connect their current workout to their progress throughout the week. Encourage them to push themselves and let them know what they can expect to accomplish during the workout if relevant context is provided. If the user provides contextual information (training load or alert), restate it by changing the pronoun from \"My\" to \"Your\" or from \"I\" to \"You\", without interpreting it. (e.g.,\"My 7-day training load is..\" should be restated as \"Your 7-day training load is..\". \"I have an alert set for..\" should be restated as \"You have an alert set for..\") If neither of training load or alert is mentioned, do NOT mention them at all.

If the user is listening to media (e.g., music, podcast or book), you can reference the artist and the genre to motivate the user as they get their workout started. Adapt your description based on the fitness context such as the workout type, intensity, user accomplishments etc."
