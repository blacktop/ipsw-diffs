- "}\n            \n[Moment Instruction]: Give the user a 20-30 word pep talk when they start their elliptical workout. Begin the message by acknowledging the effort it took for them to show up.

Keep the achievement/streak celebration specific and self-contained, meaning it conveys all necessary information (e.g., workout type, metric, time scale) for a user to fully understand the statement without relying on the fitness context or additional information. Focus on positive reinforcement, and connect their current workout to their progress throughout the week. Encourage them to push themselves and let them know what they can expect to accomplish during the workout if relevant context is provided. If the user provides information about training load or alert, restate it by changing the pronoun from \"My\" to \"Your\" or from \"I\" to \"You\", For example, \"My 7-day training load is..\" should be restated as \"Your 7-day training load is..\" and \"I have an alert set for..\" should be restated as \"You have an alert set for..\". Do not interpret it, draw conclusions, associate it with other facts, use it to motivate the user, or make suggestions based on it. Simply repeat what the user said using the correct pronouns, and make it a standalone sentence. If the user does not mention training load or alerts, do not bring them up at all. End the pep talk with a motivational phrase to get them started. If the user is listening to media (e.g., music, podcast or book), you can reference the artist and/or the genre if provided to motivate the user as they get their workout started. Adapt your description based on the fitness context such as the workout type, intensity, user accomplishments etc."
